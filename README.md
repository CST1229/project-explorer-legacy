# Project Explorer Legacy

The latest state of Project Explorer before this version was scrapped and it was rewritten in Vue (which now is Project Explorer 0.9/1.x). Written in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. Uploaded mostly for historical reasons.

This version is very unfinished (for example, the menu bar has no functionality at all).

Unlike later versions, this version uses the 404 page for routing instead of being a single-page app (so for example, /projects/104 to see inside project ID 104), so it will probably not work on GitHub Pages (aside from username.github.io repos) without a bit of modification.

All files except this file (the README) are untouched from their original states on October 25th 2021 (or 26th for 404.html) (from file modification dates; this originally wasn't a git repo).

This will probably break after project tokens are implemented.
